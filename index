81: min-cost-path search (djikstra?) via bfs.
		Prevents generating paths from node using current path length if node has already been visited with a shorter pathlength
233: fibonacci

387:divisibility: primes
	dynamic generation of integers via dfs: 
		higest dfs level generates smallest numbers, each level adds digits at back to generate larger numbers.
		Each level has access to sum of its numbers digits
		Each level has access to the number from the last level
		Each level has access to the sum of digits of the number of last level
