250: (DONT USE method of repeated squares) to calculate i^i % 250 for i in [1..250250] find the order of each j \in [0..249] in Z_250, then calculate k = i%250, get the order m of k mod 250, find minimum r such that i = m*s+r, then i^i % 250 = k^r % 250. Count how many times we get each value in [0..250]. Use that to see how many subsets of [i^i % 250 for i in [1..250250]] sum up to 0 % 250. Probably done by using cominatronics
353:
    Find all integer solutions (a,b,c) for a^2+b^2+c^2 = r^2, for some integer r. Best if i i only need O(n) time complexity, where n is thhe number of integer solutions, to do the actual generation. 
    Will probably need to generate a bunch of primes at start. 
    Some form of trigonometry needed. (Length of a path between two points on a sphere).

273: Sum of squares:
    Generate all primes of the form 4k+1 with 4k+1 < 150.
    Solve a^2+b^2 = p for each of the primes generated.
    We know each p has one and only one solution (a,b) for the equation.
    Now we see that if we multiply two primes together we get:
    (a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2)=(ac+bd)^2+(ad-bc)^2.
    How many solutions does this generate when we are calculating two of the primes together? What if we a multiplying a squarefree multiple of some of the primes to a unused prime in the group?.
    Do this for every combination of the prime to get every solution we want.

352:
    Probably just divide and conquer with probabilities

355:
    Find all primes below 200000. Sum of all primes over 100000 plus a the maximum sum of coprime numbers containing primes only below 100000.

364:
    Probably a fun and not so hard one. Probably uses the fibonacci sequence, and some permuatation/combination shit.

389:
    Probably a cool probabilistic problem.
    Need to know what variance is.

267:
    Probablities man. Maximizing shit. Cool stuff.

271:
    Perhaps its good practice for alco?
272:
    Continuation of 271

53:
    Pascals triangle holds the answer. Basic.

69:
    Totient stuff

70:
    Totient stuff.

187:
    Probably easy. Prime factorization, combinatroncs.

146:
    Fun stuffs. Alco stuffs.

263:
    Number theory, yay.
